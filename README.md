ChewySwap is the first multi-doggo-chain Decentralized Exchange on both Shibarium and Dogechain. This repository contains the official default token list for the Shibarium side.

## More Information

ChewySwap exchange was created to help bring together the two amazing communities of Shiba Inu and Doge, once thought to be rivals we believe that all shibes can play together without getting too ruff! Having been in operation on Dogechain for over a year so far we've already built trust in the community and have a huge advantage over other DEX deploying on Shibarium in that we already have a preinstalled community of users and based developers once we go live to take over Shibarium!

## Token Creation

Either use our [no-code token deployer](https://token.chewy.build) or deploy a custom token contract using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org). For tax/reflection tokens our Shibarium router address is:

> Shibarium Router: [0x2875F2D86d83635A859029872e745581530cEec7](https://www.shibariumscan.io/address/0x2875F2D86d83635A859029872e745581530cEec7)

And we use the official Wrapped Bone smart contract deployed by the Shibarium team here: [0xC76F4c819D820369Fb2d7C1531aB3Bb18e6fE8d8](https://www.shibariumscan.io/address/0xC76F4c819D820369Fb2d7C1531aB3Bb18e6fE8d8?ref=blog.shib.io)

## How to Submit your Token

Create a commit in ./tokens/addresses creating a folder with your token's Shibarium contract address, in it containing your token's **transparent** background **logo.png** no larger than **250x250**! It's required that your token has enough liquidity on ChewySwap to be properly traded and that the project's main liquidity is **locked** for a reasonable period of time. * Minimum starting liquidity varies by project's current state and quality. You may also submit your token logo and information to an admin in our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/chewyswapcommunity) but submitting to GitHub is preferred to keep everything in one place.

New tokens will be added on a weekly basis as long as the project has a **safe** contract with its code **verified** on [Shibariumscan](https://www.shibariumscan.io). For faster consideration leave a link to your project's Telegram group or your admin's Telegram handle in the commit description. To expedite the process you may join our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/ChewySwapCommunity) and let us know you made a commit with your logo.

## Farming Pool Consideration

After your token has been vetted/whitelisted you can contact us on our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/chewyswapcommunity) to discuss getting your project added to the farming or staking pools. In return it's appreciated that projects promote the new pool in their project's Telegram and Twitter page, properly linking to ChewySwap's website and Telegram in case anyone needs support with accessing the pools.
